      <description>I always remember when started to write code, it was in high school writing my very first Pascal code and competing with another student to show them that my program was better than theirs. Thatâ€™s the time I found myself useful and very very exited to finish and gaining the response to my program.
The code was my friend since then. Nothing could make me happier than sitting in front of the monitor through the day in my school lab.</description>
