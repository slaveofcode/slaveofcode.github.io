      <description>You know i am really interested with two compiled language which is Rust-lang and Golang from this mid-year of 2017. I think i am are ready to move into more capability which is available on these languages with pretty efficient, fast on managing it&amp;rsquo;s memory and cpu process.
Node.js is cool but instead using a node program to handle some various cpu-intensive or very large memory consumptions around my application. I tend to use a right tool for a right job.</description>
