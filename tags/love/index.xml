      <description>I always remember when started to write code, it was on highschool writing my very first pascal code and competing with another students to show them that my program was better than theirs. That&amp;rsquo;s the time I found my self useful and very very exited to finish and gaining the response about my program.
Code was my friend since then. Nothing could make me happier than sitting in front of the monitor through the day on my school lab.</description>
